To run the React app, follow these steps:
Install Node.js on your computer. You can download it from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Open the terminal in visual studio code and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
To install npm (if youn don't have already):

Install Node.js on your computer. npm is included with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

To check if you have npm installed, open the terminal and run the following command:
  ## `npm -v`

if it doesn't work or you get an error, run the following command on your computer terminal, close the react app and open it on visual studio again.

  ## `npm install --global npm`

If you get a version number in response, you have npm installed already. Otherwise, visit the official npm website (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

To install yarn , write the folloing command in your terminal:

## `npm install --global yarn`

then go to the project directory and install the dependencies by runnin the following command:

## `yarn`

After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:

## `yarn run dev`

you will recieve a link in your terminal, click on it and you will be directed to this address to see the app in action.

Note: If you're using a different package manager like npm, replace yarn with npm in the above commands.I would recomend yarn.


To build the app, run the following command and you will get a build-all folder in your directory.
## `yarn run build`

To host the app you can uplode and deploy the build-all folder manually on (https://www.netlify.com).
